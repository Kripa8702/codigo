  <h2>Mission</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="boody">
  <p>Our Mission is to make learning coding more easily available to people ,even though there are a plethora of websites out there which offer the same , we believe we are different from them as we are open source and free , and it dosent cost a dime to learn from us </p>
  <br>
  <h3><b>Open-Source and Friendly</b></h3>
  <br>
  <p>
  	We believe knowledge is power and we dont want you guys to have any doubts , so we have created a discord channel as well to ask any questions you have 
  </p><br>
  <h3>What makes Us Different</h3><br>
  	We are still growing , but this only means we will concentrate on you guys more and help you get intrested in coding and more importantly tech!

  	You could also help us contribute by contributing to our repo
